# Eth_Project_2

### Objective
This project is the Student Account Management contract in which there is an employee(database manager) can be able to add the details of new student only if he enters his correct id. Further more, the student will be able to register themself if he took admission. For the registration process, he needs to pay the complete fee.
The employee could be able to maintain the record of all students and identify them through their unique id's (roll no.).

The contract is deployed with frontend and can be accessed after cloning the github by using the below steps-
  1. Inside the project directory, in the terminal type: npm i
  2. Open two additional terminals in your VS code
  3. In the second terminal type: npx hardhat node
  4. In the third terminal, type: npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy.js
  5. Back in the first terminal, type npm run dev to launch the front-end.
  After this, the project will be running on your localhost. Typically at http://localhost:3000/

Make sure to connect your Metamask with your wallet.
